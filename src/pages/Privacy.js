        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Our Partners.</i> We&nbsp;allow third parties, including carefully selected ad&nbsp;networks and business partners (referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;«<u>Our Partners</u>»), to&nbsp;display advertising on&nbsp;our Website. Our Partners may, for instance, collect, use and share your information to&nbsp;make or&nbsp;help&nbsp;us make predictions about your interests, and may provide you with offers, promotional materials, and advertisements. In&nbsp;addition, Our Partners may be&nbsp;collecting certain information related to&nbsp;your&nbsp;PC, laptop, mobile phone or&nbsp;other device attributes and traffic/session information. Our Website permits Our Partners to&nbsp;collect your Personally Identifiable Information to&nbsp;provide personalized advertising to&nbsp;you. Our Partners are leading digital performance-based advertising groups which put great effort in&nbsp;making sure that your personal information is&nbsp;safe and used properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Service Providers.</i> Your information may be&nbsp;collected by&nbsp;entities that provide services to&nbsp;us, including companies that deliver web analytics, data processing, data enhancement and customer insights, advertising, email distribution, and other services.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Other Parties (when required by&nbsp;law or&nbsp;as&nbsp;necessary to&nbsp;protect our services).</i> We&nbsp;may disclose your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to&nbsp;other parties in&nbsp;order&nbsp;to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>protect our legal rights or&nbsp;property, the legal rights or&nbsp;property of&nbsp;our affiliates, and sites or&nbsp;services we&nbsp;work with;</li>
          <li>protect the rights, safety and security of&nbsp;our users, ourselves, or&nbsp;any other person or&nbsp;entity;</li>
          <li>prevent fraud (or&nbsp;for risk management purposes); <br />or</li>
          <li>comply with applicable legal requirements, legal process or&nbsp;request for cooperation by&nbsp;a&nbsp;governmental or&nbsp;supervisory authority, whether or&nbsp;not legally required. For example, we&nbsp;may be&nbsp;required to&nbsp;disclose your information to&nbsp;meet national security or&nbsp;law enforcement requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <i>Other Parties (in&nbsp;connection with transfer of&nbsp;assets).</i> If&nbsp;we&nbsp;make a&nbsp;sale or&nbsp;transfer of&nbsp;assets, or&nbsp;are otherwise involved in&nbsp;a&nbsp;merger or&nbsp;transfer (or&nbsp;due diligence related to&nbsp;such a&nbsp;transaction), or&nbsp;in&nbsp;the unlikely event of&nbsp;bankruptcy, we&nbsp;may transfer your Personally Identifiable Information as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;that transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Use for Analytical and Ad&nbsp;Serving Purposes.</i> We&nbsp;use standard tools common within the industry, such as&nbsp;Google Analytics, to&nbsp;collect information about use of&nbsp;our Website. These tools collect information such as&nbsp;how often you visit our Website and what other sites you visited prior to&nbsp;reaching our Website. We&nbsp;use the information we&nbsp;obtain from analytical tools for the purposes of&nbsp;improving our Website. The analytical tools collect only the&nbsp;IP address assigned to&nbsp;your computer or&nbsp;other device and your browser settings as&nbsp;of&nbsp;the moment you visit our Website, rather than your name or&nbsp;other identifying information.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&nbsp;also use standard tools common within the industry, such as&nbsp;DoubleClick for Publishers operated by&nbsp;Google, enabling placement and management of&nbsp;personalized advertising services on&nbsp;our Website. These tools use cookies to&nbsp;target advertising based on&nbsp;what is&nbsp;relevant to&nbsp;you as&nbsp;a&nbsp;user to&nbsp;improve advertising and to&nbsp;avoid showing ads that you have already seen. Cookies themselves contain no&nbsp;Personally Identifiable Information. They relate to&nbsp;your web activity, rather than your identity. Tools such as&nbsp;DoubleClick will send a&nbsp;cookie to&nbsp;your web browser after any impression, click, or&nbsp;other activity by&nbsp;you on&nbsp;our servers. If&nbsp;your web browser accepts the cookie, the cookie will be&nbsp;planted on&nbsp;your web browser. DoubleClick will usually send a&nbsp;cookie to&nbsp;your web browser when you visit any webpage displaying DoubleClick ads. Webpages containing DoubleClick ads include ad&nbsp;tags that instruct web browsers to&nbsp;request ad&nbsp;content from our servers. When the server delivers the ad&nbsp;content, it&nbsp;will also send a&nbsp;cookie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, our Website relies on&nbsp;common industry tools Google Display Network Impression Reporting and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. These tools help&nbsp;us understand the composition of&nbsp;viewers of&nbsp;our Website in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;gender, age and interests. We&nbsp;need this information in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;understand what types of&nbsp;creative content we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;develop to&nbsp;suit the interests of&nbsp;different demographic and interest groups. In&nbsp;addition, Our Partners may need this information to&nbsp;develop marketing content. You may, at&nbsp;any time, opt out of&nbsp;Google Analytics tracking, including Google Display Network Impression Reporting and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, by&nbsp;installing the <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On</a>. You may also opt out of&nbsp;ad&nbsp;serving through <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/u/0/authenticated" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google’s opt-out page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The personal data privacy aspects of&nbsp;all Google products, services and features, including Google Analytics and DoubleClick, are covered by&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>. Please be&nbsp;assured that we&nbsp;never combine the information collected through the use of&nbsp;Google Analytics or&nbsp;DoubleClick with any other Personally Identifiable Information. Moreover, permanent cookies planted on&nbsp;your web browser by&nbsp;Google products to&nbsp;identify you as&nbsp;a&nbsp;unique user the next time you visit our Website, cannot be&nbsp;used by&nbsp;anyone but Google. The ability of&nbsp;Google to&nbsp;use and share information collected by&nbsp;Google Analytics or&nbsp;DoubleClick about your visits to&nbsp;our Website is&nbsp;restricted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/doubleclick/tos/dfp-api-terms.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DoubleClick Terms and Conditions</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Analytics Terms of&nbsp;Use</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can opt out of&nbsp;ads personalization using Google’s Ads Settings by&nbsp;following the instructions contained on&nbsp;the following resource of&nbsp;Google&nbsp;— <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings</a>. If&nbsp;you choose to&nbsp;opt out of&nbsp;ads personalization, you will no&nbsp;longer receive personalized advertising.
        </p>
        <h3>5. Cross-Border Transfer of&nbsp;Information</h3>
        <p>
          We&nbsp;generally maintain centralized servers and systems in&nbsp;Europe and may maintain servers and systems elsewhere. These servers and systems are managed by&nbsp;us or&nbsp;on&nbsp;our behalf, or&nbsp;by&nbsp;our affiliates located in&nbsp;Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          In&nbsp;the event of&nbsp;transfer and processing of&nbsp;your Personally Identifiable Information outside the EEA for the purposes described above, we&nbsp;will ascertain that the information receives the same level of&nbsp;protection as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;remained within the EEA, including when entering into data transfer agreements, using the EU&nbsp;Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or&nbsp;by&nbsp;relying on&nbsp;certification schemes such as&nbsp;the EU-US Privacy Shield.
        </p>
        <h3>6. How We&nbsp;Keep Your Information Secure</h3>
        <p>
          We&nbsp;use commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to&nbsp;protect your Personally Identifiable Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction in&nbsp;accordance with requirements of&nbsp;applicable laws.
        </p>
        <h3>7. Use of ‘Cookies’</h3>
        <p>
          We&nbsp;also use (or&nbsp;may use) ‘cookies’ when you visit our Website. For more information on&nbsp;our use of&nbsp;cookies, please refer to&nbsp;our Cookie Policy.
        </p>
        <h3>8. Use of&nbsp;Information for Personal Advertising</h3>
        <p>
          The information collected by&nbsp;Our Partners is&nbsp;used to&nbsp;analyze trends, understand user activities and gather demographic information to&nbsp;enable, manage and develop their personalized ads and related services. Our Partners may share such information with their affiliates. To&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, Our Partners use technologies such as&nbsp;cookies and web beacons to&nbsp;collect information about your interaction with our Website and third-party websites. This type of&nbsp;information does not identify you personally and, typically, is&nbsp;aggregated with other data to&nbsp;create segments —groups of&nbsp;users and general interest categories that are inferred based on&nbsp;a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;factors (for example, «sports fan»). Our Partners use this information to&nbsp;form a&nbsp;more accurate picture of&nbsp;the interests of&nbsp;the audiences with which they interact&nbsp;— including you&nbsp;— so&nbsp;that their ads are more relevant to&nbsp;those interests.
